# Interactive Photo Gallery

This project is an interactive photo gallery built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a responsive design that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices. The gallery allows users to view thumbnails, open full-size images in a modal, and interact with various animations and effects.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The gallery adapts its layout and behavior based on the device's screen size, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Thumbnail Navigation**: Users can browse through the image thumbnails and click on them to open the full-size image.
- **Full-Size Image Viewing**: When a thumbnail is clicked, the corresponding full-size image is displayed in a modal window, allowing users to view the image in greater detail.
- **Image Zoom and Animation**: The full-size image in the modal has a smooth zoom animation when opening, making it more engaging and visually appealing.
- **Hover Effects**: On desktop devices, hovering over an image thumbnail applies a zoom and brightness effect to the image, creating an interesting visual interaction.
- **Mobile Optimizations**: On mobile devices, the gallery is optimized for touch interactions, providing a seamless experience when browsing and opening images.
